Story: Sea lions have been dissappearing from the bay. One day our hero, Super Sea Lion (SSL), sees a boat capture a sea lion and sail away. SSL is determined to find out what has been happening to his friends and relatives, so he follows the boat. Along the way, SSL overcomes various enemies and bosses. At the end of the game SSL discovers that the sea lions have been enslaved in an evil sea creature show. SSL must defeat the evil show master and his henchmen to free the sea lions, dolphins, and killer whales locked up in the tanks. 

The game is comprised of levels with a story board between each level indicating SSL's progress in the story. SSL travels through the levels, eating fish, squid, lobster, clams, and crab for points. SSL must either avoid or defeat enemies in his way. At the end of each level he defeats a boss. In the final level SSL defeats the Big Boss and frees the enslaved sea creatures.
