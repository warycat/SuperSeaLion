Boss ideas:

I was thinking that there should be some motivation for the boss to hate Super Sea Lion. When the boss appears, a text bubble shows up with a brief dialog between the boss and Super Sea Lion. 

1. The Big Boss: A fishing boat with a furious owner who has it in for sea lions. When the SSL appears he says something like: "You damned sea lions are eating up all the mackerel, ruining my business. It's time for me solve the sea lion over-popluation problem, starting with you!" SSL says something back, owner pulls out a shotgun, then they go at it.

The boat is protected by a crust of barnicles, each of which is poisonous to SSL. SSL has to break through the crust to damage the hull by spitting at it (or by tail flipper attack?). Some of the barnacles release food that can be spitting ammunition for SSL. Or SSL can attack the owner directly, if he can jump into the air and spit at him. 

The owner can shoot at SSL with his shotgun. He also has a first-mate which throws stuff at SSL for less damage. When the hull gets breached, the owner will man a harpoon that inflicts a huge amount of damage on SSL. 

The boat can also squirt an oil slick that damages the SSL a small amount over time as SSL gets nearer. This dissipates over time and the cycle repeats.
